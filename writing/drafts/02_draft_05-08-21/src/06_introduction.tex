\section{Introduction}

\TODO{UPDATE: In the year 2016, over 9.4 million people worldwide died of ischemic 
heart disease (IHD). IHD is responsible for 16.6\% of all deaths, making
it the most common cause of death globally. All forms of 
cardiovascular disease make up 31.4\% of all deaths (17.9 million). 
Death caused by IHD disproportionally affects people 
over 50 years of age, with 91\% of deaths for men and 95\% of deaths for women 
occurring in that age range. In Kyrgyzstan, 13\% of all deaths in 2016 were 
caused by IHD \mycite{who2018}.}\par

% add statistical data about arrhythmia too, in case I need to cut the ihd data
% use the new who data, take KG out of the picture

\TODO{FOCUS MORE ON MY ACTUAL TOPIC:\\
Ischemic heart disease is characterized by restricted blood flow to an area 
of the heart, causing it to not receive enough blood and oxygen. Blood flow
restriction is caused by a blockage (or narrowing) in a blood vessel supplying the heart
muscle. An artery can be blocked by a blood clot, but the most common cause is 
plaque buildup, which is called atherosclerosis. If the circulation to the
heart is completely blocked, the cells in the heart muscle begin to die. This
is called myocardial infarction, more commonly known as a heart attack. The
deprivation of oxygen the heart experiences leads to the characteristic chest
pain commonly associated with heart attacks \mycite{iom2010}.}\par

% stick to ischaemia a little less, add arrhythmia to the mix

\TODO{mention arrhythmia too, it is what the mit database looks at}

IHD can be diagnosed before it leads to a heart attack.
The diagnosis can be performed based on a patient's medical history,
pharmacologically induced stress, or stress induced by physical exercise.
During an exercise stress test, an electrocardiograph (sometimes combined with
other methods) records the patient's heart activity, resulting in an electrocardiogram
(ECG) \mycite{iom2010}. 

% also add that ecgs are performed when people present with unidentified chest
% pains or something like that

\TODO{make this its own paragraph section}

\TODO{
   \\- heart's electrical activity
   \\- up to 12 leads
   \\- common medical diagnostic tool
   \\- electricity is what causes the contraction
   \\- this can be measured on the skin
   \\- a bit on ECG theory
   \\- specific electrodes and positions
   \\- mention ion flow
}

The ECG is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate patients 
with (suspected) heart problems. It is a non-invasive, real-time, and 
cost-effective method
that may be used to diagnose IHD. It is the most common tool used for cardiac
% and arrythmia
analysis and diagnosis \mycite{alghatrif2012, kligfield2007, xie2020}. The most 
common form of
the ECG is the 12-lead variant. The 12-lead ECG consists of 6 leads connected to
the limbs and 6 leads connected to the torso of the patient. 
The leads record the differences in electrical potential
between the places on the body that they are attached to. This reflects
the differences in voltage that the heart experiences with each heart beat
because those voltage differences are conducted by the body. The measurements
% this is horribly worded; they record the electricity that makes the heart
% beat
are taken in millivolts (mV). The ECG represents the state of the heart; a 
recorded ECG has the shape of a wave (the ECG wave) \mycite{kligfield2007,
xie2020}.

\TODO{datasets are available online, the most significant leads tend to be
included}

If the state of the heart beat changes  as the result of 
a disease like IHD (changing the measurable potentials or their occurrence over 
time), the ECG is able to record these changes.\par
% it can record the electrical activity, so when it changes based on a disease,
% the ECG reflects that

The characteristic shape of an ECG for two heart beats is shown in
\figref{fig:ecg-waveform}; the figure is taken from \mycite{wasilewski2012}. 
The figure has been
annotated to show the significant features of an ECG. The peaks (or waves) P, 
Q, R, S, T, and U, as well as the segments between them, are the focus of ECG
analysis. Multiple points together form what is called
a complex; \TODO{FIX: the QRS complex is a good example of this. Using these waves, the
heart activity can be described and analyzed. In an ECG, the P-wave is the result
of the atria depolarizing, which is the process of blood entering the heart as the
first step in a heart beat. The QRS complex represents ventricular 
depolarization, the contraction of the heart causing it to pump blood.
The T-wave is the return of the ventricle to its polarized state. The U-wave is
only present in roughly 25\% of the population and may be caused by
mechanical-electric feedback. The RR interval can be used to
calculate the heart rate because it represents one complete heart beat
\mycite{wasilewski2012}. The shape of the P, Q, R, S, T, and U waves as well as 
the duration of various intervals between them are used as indicators of 
cardiac diseases.}

\TODO{UPDATE TO TIKZ FIGURE:}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \center
    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{wasilewski2012}}
    \caption{A schematic of an ECG waveform, annotated; from \mycite{wasilewski2012}}
    \label{fig:ecg-waveform}
    \vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

\TODO{also: lots of data, cannot be analyzed quickly}

Using an ECG to diagnose a cardiac condition is difficult in practice. Small changes
in the components of the ECG can be indicators of diseases and those changes
can be overlooked, even by
trained and specialized physicians. The chance to make a mistake is even higher for
non-specialized physicians and trainees \mycite{alghatrif2012, xie2020}. 

\TODO{make it about assisting in their diagnosis by pointing out important
segments -> discords}
% what can ECG analysis really add here?

For the diagnosis of IHD, changes in the ST-segment and T-wave are of 
particular interest. An elevation of the ST-segment compared to a normal heart
beat is one of the main indications of IHD and myocardial infarction.
A downward depression of the ST-segment, especially in combination with chest
pain, is another indication of IHD. The changes in the ST-segment are thought
to be caused by current flow between healthy heart muscle and ischemic heart
muscle \mycite{rautaharju2009, wasilewski2012}.\par
% add what can be done to arrhythmia and the like

\TODO{after introducing idea of discord discovery, introduce ECGs as time
series:
    \\- ECGs are multivariate: 2-12 leads
    \\- discrete: measured at discrete points
    \\- ordered sequences: come one after another after equal time segments
    \\- 
}

\TODO{then, time series analysis methods are ready to be applied to ECGs}

\TODO{what is required of the method:\\
    \\- fast
    \\- accurate
    \\- adaptable
    \\- versatile\\
The diagnosis of IHD on the basis of an ECG is time sensitive. If
a patient has IHD or suffers from a heart attack, treatment has to be started
as soon as possible. Some forms of treatment are most effective in the first
3 hours after symptom onset and lose most of their effectiveness after 9 to 12
hours. The diagnosis required for treatment to begin should thus be as quick as 
possible. The ECG delivering information in real-time is an advantage here, 
even though
there are more time consuming methods that can deliver more accurate results
than an ECG \mycite{herring2006}.}\par

\TODO{WHY automated ECG analysis:\\
The widespread use of ECGs and the time-sensitive nature of their application 
as diagnostic tools makes errors, delays, or inconsistencies in their
interpretation unacceptable. A recent approach to minimizing this problem
is the application of computer technology in ECG recording, storage, and
analysis. The main steps of computerized ECG analysis are}
\mycite{kligfield2007}
\TODO{fix this one, adapt to my writing}
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\arabic*)]
    \item signal acquisition and filtering,
    \item data transformation or preparation for processing,
    \item \label{enum:3} waveform recognition,
    \item \label{enum:4}feature extraction, and
    \item classification or diagnosis.
\end{enumerate*}

This research will investigate steps \ref{enum:3} and \ref{enum:4} through
the use of different feature extraction algorithms. The ECG data will be
retrieved from the European ST-T Database. This database provides ECG 
recordings that can be used as trial data to test feature extraction algorithms. 
The European ST-T Database contains annotations made by cardiologists 
indicating the ST-segment, T-wave, and their changes. They also include
information about the suspected disease \mycite{physionet, taddei1992}. This 
information can be used to determine the effectiveness of the feature 
extraction algorithms.

- most recent advance is the use of computerized methods for storage and
analysis
- in the US, most ECGs are recorded and interpreted digitally; their
implementations might be different and thus not necessarily comparable
- the ECG processing pipeline is the following:
    1. signal acquisition and filtering
    2. data transformation, finding the complexes, classification of the
       complexes 
    3. waveform recognition -- finding the onset and offset of the waves
    4. feature extractoin -- measurement of amplitudes and intervals
    5. diagnostic classification
- the 12-lead ecg signal: records potential differences between spots on the
body during each hearbeat (depolarization and repolarization and voltage of the
heart cells)
- the main frequency of the QRS complex on the bodies surface is about 10Hz,
most information for adults in found below 100Hz; fundamental frequency of
T waves is about 1-2 Hz
- the signal processing can easily obscure the important information in an ECG,
even though a range of 1-30 Hz yields a perfectly good-looking ECG free of
artifacts
- ECG sampling
    - until the 70s, direct writing ECGs were the norm, those were continuous
    in nature
    - initial analog to digital sampling is often performed at 10-15 kHz
    - oversampling is used primarily because pacemaker pulses are too short to
    be picked up in 500 to 1000 Hz sampling rates
- low-frequency filtering
    - heart rate is generally above 0.5 Hz (30 bpm), below 40 bpm is uncommon
    - we cannot cut of here because that would distort the signal, particularly
    to the ST segment
    - digital filtering can be used as a way around this [23]
    - bidirectional filter that passes once with time, once against time [41]
    - this approach is not possible in real-time, but in post-processing it
    would work
    - a flat step response filter can used in real-time [42]
- high-frequency filtering
    - data at 500 samples per second is recommended to reach the required 150
    Hz cutoff to reduce frequency errors to about 1\%
- single lead complex
    - by using templates, variability caused by breathing or other irrelevant
    disturbances can be removed
- ecg compression techniques
    - to make storage more efficient, FFT, discrete cosine transform, wavelet
    transforms can be used
- ECG standard leads: 3 limb leads, 3 augmented limb leads, 3 exploring
electrodes, 6 leads on the chest
- computerized interpretation: first preprocessing (filtering, sampling,
template formation, feature extraction), then diagnosis or classification
- heuristic used to be the norm (decision trees, etc), but statistical methods
are better because they can form better judgements (one must make sure that
these methods have enough data of varying kinds to create diagnoses that are
reliable)

- since 1910 people have been suspecting that artery occlusion can be a cause
of chest pain
- since 1920 we know of the most common symptoms of myocardial ischemia
- in the first few minutes the T wave becomes tall and upright, then the whole
ST segment becomes elevated relative to the end of the PR segment
- after a couple hours the T wave may invert
- the development of Q waves can be an indicator of myocardial infarction
- there are certain problems in ischemia detection using ECG, some types are
hard to spot, depending on where in the heart the ischemic tissue is, the
symptoms can look different on the ECG
- apparently the exercise stress test is about 63\% sensitive and 77\% specific
- ischemia is delineated by: "ST elevation is based on ST/junctional ST 
elevation of 50.1 mV elevation in 51 inferior/lateral leads, or 50.2 mV in 51
anterior leads. Trials performed by the GUSTO group looking at the benefit of 
thrombolysis have used more strict definitions such as 50.1 mV in 52 contiguous 
limb leads or 50.2 mV in 52 contiguous precordial leads." this had 56\%
sensitivity and 94\% specificity
- ECG is the main tool to select patients that would benefit from thrombolysis,
there is a 12h window for effective treatment
- a stent may be even more effective
- continuous ST segment monitoring is important while T wave inversion is
controversial, while it is a marker of severe coronary artery disease
- thrombolysis when the ECG data is there is only really effective at up to 3h,
there is little benefit after 9-12h
- ischemia diagnosis can be improved by correlating heart rate and ST segment
depression or elevation
- while ECG is not the most accurate at first, it is real-time and thus does
not cause disadvantageous delays in treatment -- it is also continuously being
improved with better diagnostic methods.

An abnormal exercise ECG is defined by ST-segment displacement, generally
a depression by more than 1mm, measured 0.08 seconds after the J point, that is
horizontal and downsloping. 
% cite Gibbons et al., 2002b
These types of results are generally reported as normal or abnormal, and
ischemia as positive or negative. Less severe abnormalities can include
false-positive or false-negative results, but more severe abnormalities are
pretty certainly bad. 
Other tests are pharmacologic stress tests (stress induced by pharmacologic
agents), or computed tomography of the heart.

It has been observed that the IHD mortality rate is slowly decreasing. This
downward trend could be explained by improved health care systems, which can be
connected to economic growth, or advances in the treatment of cardiovascular  
diseases. Improved treatment options are especially important for heart 
diseases like IHD \cite{nowbar2019}.\par

                either have good time and bad frequency or vice versa
            \item the wavelet transform has a time scale resolution scheme that
                makes this simpler
            \item wavelets are good for all frequencies because they are
                adaptive
            \item their high resolution can give them the edge
            \item there are many different options of wavelets that are good
                for different things
            \item src [71] is myocardial infarction
            \item DWT is a good computational tool to assess ECG changes
            \item for statistical and morphological features 
            \item higher-order statistics have proven to be good at ECG
                analysis
        \end{itemize}
    \item dimensionality reduction is important because while more feature mean
        more accuracy, they also increase the computational cost
    \item most data has correlated variables, meaning they can be ignored
    \item feature selection tries to select a subset of the original features
        and only select the best ones -- options are filters, wrappers, and
        embedded
    \item filters are the most simple version, they simply remove the redundant
        data and then return the relevant data
    \item filters use algorithms to assign scores to individual features
    \item filters are fast and independent of the classification, but they may
        not be super good or precise
    \item feature extraction reduces the dimension of the information but does
        not throw out information, which makes it more efficient and precise
    \item this includes primary component analysis and other types of analysis
    \item some features of an ECG appear randomly, also entropy, energy, and
        fractal dimension cannot be easily spotted with the naked eye
    \item kernels can be used for locally linear embedding
    \item some machine learning decision making algorithms are k nearest
        neighbors KNN, support vector machine SVM
    \item KNN is pretty simple and divides points into multiple group using
        distance; data imbalance is hard to overcome and they are expensive for
        high-dimensional data
    \item SVM has good training ability on small data sets and it is a good
        all-rounder
    \item there is no standard about the construction of a NN for ECG analysis
    \item a general end-to-end model seems to be the best solution, removing
        the need for optimization at each and every step -- feature extraction
        is shifted to the learning body, which is a nice solution
    \item a list of all the databases and what they are good at
    \item good list of applications of the whole thing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item databases:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database for normal ECGs
            \item European ST-T Database for ST and T wave changes -- patients
                with ischemia
            \item INCART database for ischemia, arrhythmias, coronary artery
                disease
            \item Lobachevsky University Electrocardiography Database for
                12-lead stuff for different cardiological diseases
            \item long therm ST database -- for st segment detection
            \item suggestions why only 5 minutes are used/necessary to detect
                stuff
        \end{itemize}
    \item use the Butterworth filter in the Julia DSP.jl package to filter the
        noise out
    \item use FFT, SFFT, Wavelet for feature extraction, also in julia if
        possible
    \item find some simple type of filter to do feature selection -- 
    \item classification could be done using the NearestNeighbors.jl package
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outline}

\subsubsection{Problem Statement}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ischemia and similar diseases are some of the most deadly and common
        diseases
    \item IHD -- what is it? how can it be diagnosed (ECG)? how can it be
        treated(Stents)?
    \item what is the research problem that people are facing?
    \item the QRST–wave complex changes when ischemia is present, enabling its 
        detection
    \item heat disease is a significant and deadly medical issue
    \item poorer countries like Kyrgyzstan are disproportionately affected
        because many of the newer and better methods cannot be afforded
        / implemented
    \item health expenditure in KG is low, the lower it is the worse these
        conditions are 
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Rationale -- Justification -- Why}

\begin{itemize}
    \item when it comes to ischemic heart disease (IHD), rapid decision making
        is important -- why
    \item ECG is one of the most widely used diagnostic tools -- why
    \item reading an ECG is very difficult, which leads to different results
        among different physicians -- relevance
    \item this could reduce the time it takes to diagnose IHD, which is
        crucial --
    \item detect changes during myocardial ischemia, some of those remain
        invisible to physicians
    \item promising method because other people are doing this
    \item what are the applications in practice?
    \item freely available ECGs on the internet -- MIT-BIH, European ST-T 
        database and the others
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Goals and Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item to develop software that analyzes 12–lead ECG to detect IHD -- how
        will we do that?
    \item create a 12–lead ECG analysis tool to diagnose IHD
    \item mathematically model the changes in the ECG compared to at-rest and
        normal ECGs
    \item mathematical model and implementation that can speed up diagnosis
        (which is critical)
    \item get 100 digitized ECGs from healthy volunteers
    \item use FFT for analysis
    \item Fourier Transform, Fast Fourier Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform

    \item we will mathematically model the changes of the ECG compared to
        at--rest, nominal ECGs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{questions, problematic, rationale}

\begin{itemize}
    \item the ECG is the most widely used method to assess heart
        conditions
    \item the QRST--wave complex changes when ischemia is present, enabling its
        detection
    \item a mathematical model could make the analysis of ECGs easier for
        doctors and speed up their diagnosis
    \item the model needs to work well for this to be possible
    \item such a tool would remove some of the problems that normally exist
        (mentioned above)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{background, literature review}

\begin{itemize}
    \item heart disease is a significant medical issue
    \item one of the most deadly ones
    \item middle income countries like KG are hit harder
    \item health expenditure in KG is also one of the lowest
    \item IHD is the main killing disease
    \item for most treatment methods, the longer the treatment is delayed, the
        lower the chances of survival become
    \item if the necessary infrastructure is nonexistent, treatment times
        cannot be reduced to acceptable levels
    \item basically, in Kyrgyzstan most modern and good methods do not work
        because of the missing infrastructure and economic limits
    \item computers can help to analyze an ECG, which makes diagnosis easier
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item get 100 digitized ECGs from healthy volunteers
    \item from this a good model of healthy and stressed ECGs should be created
    \item maybe use FFT for the analysis
    \item use a Maplesoft Signal Processing Tool for wave analysis
\end{itemize}
