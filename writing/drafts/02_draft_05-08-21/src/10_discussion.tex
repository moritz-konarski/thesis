\subsection{MSAX vs SAX}

\TODO{use the results from the previous section to come to a conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item do proper hypothesis testing of my hypothesis statement
    \item argue which sets of parameters are the most effective
    \item judge if I proved what I set out to prove
    \item what are the uses of this method
    \item which applications could this fit?
    \item what should be done in future research
\end{itemize}
