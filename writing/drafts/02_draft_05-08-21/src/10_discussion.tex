\section{Discussion}

\TODO{expand on this, potentially merge with results section}

In the previous section the results of the data analysis were presented. It was
found that when the optimal parameters for MSAX and dual SAX are used, there is
no significant difference between the two methods. 

The most important result is the one mentioned above, as it indicates that, we
infer, the MSAX representation is equal in performance to the dual SAX method
when applied to ECGs using HOT SAX. This is congruent with the results of
\mycite{anacleto2020}, where the authors found only a slight difference between
the dual SAX method and MSAX. Discussing the actual parameters, MSAX used a PAA
segment count of 6, representing 60 times reduction in dimension, while dual
SAX performed best for $w=12$, a 30 times reduction in dimension.

\subsection{MSAX vs SAX}

\TODO{use the results from the previous section to come to a conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item do proper hypothesis testing of my hypothesis statement
    \item argue which sets of parameters are the most effective
    \item judge if I proved what I set out to prove
    \item what are the uses of this method
    \item which applications could this fit?
    \item what should be done in future research
\end{itemize}
