\TODO{what do your results mean?
\\- make sure to distiguish results and interpretation "I infer that"...
\\- start with summary of important results
\\- major patterns
\\- relations, trends, generalizations
\\- exceptions
\\- likely causes for the things above?
\\- agreement / disagreement with previous work
\\- interpret with respect to hypothesis
\\- hypothesis testing here?
\\- other questions this relates to?
\\- consider all possibilities
\\- what new insight have we gained?
\\- include the supporting evidence for each line of reasoning

\subsection{MSAX vs SAX}

\TODO{use the results from the previous section to come to a conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item do proper hypothesis testing of my hypothesis statement
    \item argue which sets of parameters are the most effective
    \item judge if I proved what I set out to prove
    \item what are the uses of this method
    \item which applications could this fit?
    \item what should be done in future research
\end{itemize}
