\section{Conclusion}

It has been demonstrated that the MSAX method performs identically to the SAX
method when optimal parameters are selected for both. Considering that the
creators of MSAX found that dual SAX is only marginally better than MSAX in ECG
classification performance supports these results. Furthermore, this paper
contributes and application of HOT SAX to multivariate time series and a usage
of MSAX as a representation for HOT SAX.\par

In future research, the methods used in this paper could be applied to
different ECG dataset to test their performance in detecting different types of 
discords, for example those caused by ischaemic heart disease. Furthermore, an
application of this method to ECGs with a higher number of leads could give
insight into the behavior of this method in an application where the
multivariate nature of the data is more important.
