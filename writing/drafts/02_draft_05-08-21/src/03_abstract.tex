\section*{Abstract}

Electrocardiograms are the most common tool used to diagnose heart diseases,
which claim more lives each year than any other disease. Since their invention,
\CITE{cite when, and who}
electrocardiograms needed to be analyzed by
a trained professional like a cardiologist. Since
\CITE{cite when it became a thing},
they can be analyzed using computers and computer-assisted methods. These
methods can be more accurate, faster, and more versatile than humans. One
discord discovery method is the Symbolic Aggregate Approximation, which
\TODO{fix this as its just wrong}
transforms an electrocardiogram into a shorter, symbolic form. This form is
faster and simpler to analyze.\newline
Multivariate Symbolic Aggregate Approximation takes more than one
electrocardiogram lead into account and should thus be more accurate when it
comes to discord discovery using Heuristically Ordered Time series using
Symbolic Aggregate Approximation.\newline
This paper shows, with 
\TODO{insert significance level},
that Multivariate Symbolic Aggregate Approximation increases the sensitivity of
HOTSAX compared to Symbolic Aggregate Approximation.
