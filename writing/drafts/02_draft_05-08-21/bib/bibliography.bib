  abstract = {Clustering is a solution for classifying enormous data when there is not any early knowledge about classes. With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using unsupervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},

  abstract = {Time Series (TS) analysis is a central research topic in areas such as finance, bioinformatics, and weather forecasting, where the goal is to extract knowledge through data mining techniques. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) is a state-of-the-art method that performs discretization and dimensionality reduction for univariate TS, which are key steps for TS representation and analysis. In this work, we propose MSAX, an extension of this algorithm to multivariate TS that takes into account the covariance structure of the data. The method is tested in several datasets, including the Pen Digits, Character Trajectories, and twelve benchmark files. Depending on the experiment, MSAX exhibits comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. Although not superior to 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) and dynamic time warping (DTW), it has interesting characteristics for some classes, and thus enriches the set of methods to analyze multivariate TS.},

  abstract = {Predictive maintenance is the monitoring of an asset's condition over its life cycle to provide a prognosis for when maintenance is required. Prior to prognosis, an asset's life cycle is modeled by a health indicator (HI) which is derived from sensor measurements and describes an asset's degradation over a life cycle. Often an asset's HI is accompanied by a health stage (HS) division, which describes the asset's life cycle condition in discrete states. Generally, HSs are discrete representations generated from discrete state transition models, dynamic state space models, or subjectively defined thresholds, which use sensor measurements to provide a HS division related to an asset's life cycle degradation. HS division methods are often designed for a specific asset in which HS division is based on user assumptions and not generalizable to different asset types or asset data representations. Also, HS division methods are often limited to a bi-state HS division (normal and failure), in which unobservable states are often generalized transition states. As assets become more complex and require multivariate measurements, more advanced methods are required to model an asset's degradation using HIs and HSs. This work introduces Relative Entropy Weibull-SAX (REWS), a data-driven HI and HS degradation modeling method for multivariate asset data. REWS constructs a HI using relative entropy to represent an asset's condition as a change of entropy during its life cycle. The relative entropy representation is then discretized into HS divisions using a Weibull distribution based Symbolic Aggregate approXimation. REWS's utility is demonstrated on the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset which describes the life cycle observations of multiple aircraft engines.},

Examples of such applications come from astronomy, biology, the web, and other domains. It is not unusual for these applications to involve numbers of time series in the order of hundreds of millions to billions. However, all relevant techniques that have been proposed in the literature so far have not considered any data collections much larger than one-million time series. In this paper, we describe iSAX 2.0, a data structure designed for indexing and mining truly massive collections of time series. We show that the main bottleneck in mining such massive datasets is the time taken to build the index, and we thus introduce a novel bulk loading mechanism, the first of this kind specifically tailored to a time series index. We show how our method allows mining on datasets that would otherwise be completely untenable, including the first published experiments to index one billion time series, and experiments in mining massive data from domains as diverse as entomology, DNA and web-scale image collections.},

In this paper, we suitably modify the three state equations corresponding to the nonlinear cross-product of states, time delay coupling of the two oscillators and low-pass filtering, using the concept of fractional derivatives. Our results show that a wide variety of ECG like waveforms can be simulated from the proposed generalized models, characterizing heart conditions under different physiological conditions. Such generalization of the modelling of ECG waveforms may be useful to understand the physiological process behind ECG signal generation in normal and abnormal heart conditions. Along with the proposed FO models, an optimization based approach is also presented to estimate the VdP oscillator parameters for representing a realistic ECG like signal.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the diagnosis and management of cardiac arrhythmias in a two-part presentation. DATA SOURCES: Articles and published peer-review abstracts on tachycardias and bradycardias. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Normal cardiac rhythm originates from impulses generated within the sinus node. These impulses are conducted to the atrioventricular node where they are delayed before they are distributed to the ventricular myocardium via the His-Purkinje system. Abnormalities in cardiac rhythm are caused by disorders of impulse generation, conduction or a combination of the two and may be life threatening due to a reduction in cardiac output or myocardial oxygenation. Cardiac arrhythmias are commonly classified as tachycardias (supraventricular or ventricular) or bradycardias. The differentiation between supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias usually requires an assessment of atrial and ventricular rhythms and their relationship to each other. In the critically ill patient the commonest tachycardia is sinus tachycardia and treatment generally consist of management of the underlying disorder. Other supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) include, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) all of which may require cardioversion, although to maintain sinus rhythm, antiarrhythmic therapy is often needed. Adenosine is useful in management and treatment many SVTs although its use in PSVT with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is hazardous. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a characteristic supraventricular tachycardia found in the critical ill patient. While it usually responds to intravenous magnesium sulphate, its management also requires removal of various precipitating factors. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) require urgent cardioversion and defibrillation respectively. Torsade de pointes should be differentiated from these ventricular arrhythmias as antiarrhythmic therapy may be contraindicated. CONCLUSIONS: Supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias in the critically ill patient often have underlying disorders that precipitate their development (e.g. hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, anti-arrhythmic proarrhythmia, myocardial ischaemia, etc). While antiarrhythmic therapy and cardioversion or defibrillation may be required to achieve sinus rhythm, correction of the associated abnormalities is also required.},

  abstract = {Multivariate time series data often have a very high dimensionality. Classifying such high dimensional data poses a challenge because a vast number of features can be extracted. Furthermore, the meaning of the normally intuitive term ``similar to'' needs to be precisely defined. Representing the time series data effectively is an essential task for decision-making activities such as prediction, clustering and classification. In this paper we propose a feature-based classification approach to classify real-world multivariate time series generated by drilling rig sensors in the oil and gas industry. Our approach encompasses two main phases: representation and classification.For the representation phase, we propose a novel representation of time series which combines trend-based and value-based approximations (we abbreviate it as TVA). It produces a compact representation of the time series which consists of symbolic strings that represent the trends and the values of each variable in the series. The TVA representation improves both the accuracy and the running time of the classification process by extracting a set of informative features suitable for common classifiers.For the classification phase, we propose a memory-based classifier which takes into account the antecedent results of the classification process. The inputs of the proposed classifier are the TVA features computed from the current segment, as well as the predicted class of the previous segment.Our experimental results on real-world multivariate time series show that our approach enables highly accurate and fast classification of multivariate time series.},

The symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) is a well-known time series representation method, which has a lower bound to Euclidean distance and may discretize continuous time series. SAX has been widely used for applications in various domains, such as mobile data management, financial investment, and shape discovery. However, the SAX representation has a limitation: Symbols are mapped from the average values of segments, but SAX does not consider the boundary distance in the segments. Different segments with similar average values may be mapped to the same symbols, and the SAX distance between them is 0. In this paper, we propose a novel representation named SAX-BD (boundary distance) by integrating the SAX distance with a weighted boundary distance. The experimental results show that SAX-BD significantly outperforms the SAX representation, ESAX representation, and SAX-TD representation.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular ischaemic diseases are one of the main causes of death all over the world. In this class of pathologies, a quick diagnosis is essential for a good prognosis in reperfusive treatment. In particular, an automatic classification procedure based on statistical analysis of teletransmitted electrocardiograph ('ECG') traces would be very helpful for an early diagnosis. This work presents an analysis of ECG traces, either physiological or pathological, of patients whose 12-lead prehospital ECG has been sent to the 118 Dispatch Center in Milan by life-support personnel. The statistical analysis starts with a preprocessing step, where functional data are reconstructed from noisy observations and biological variability is removed by a non-linear registration procedure. Then, a multivariate functional k-means clustering procedure is carried out on reconstructed and registered ECGs and their first derivatives. Hence, a new semi-automatic diagnostic procedure, based solely on the ECG morphology, is proposed to classify ECG traces; finally, the performance of this classification method is evaluated.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes the evaluation and management of ischemic heart disease, which has evolved significantly over the past decade. In particular, several clinical trials have documented the benefits of revascularization in patients with acute ischemic syndromes as well as the efficacy of medical therapy, including lifestyle modification in patients with stable coronary disease. A fundamental premise in establishing new listing criteria for ischemic heart disease disability is the linking of anatomic or structural evidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) with both functional impairment and severe anginal symptoms. A flow diagram has been introduced that depicts five pathways to meet listings, including clinical, standard exercise testing, stress imaging, and angiographic anatomic criteria, with one pathway specific for patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft and severe CHD. Because many patients with ischemic heart disease are unable to exercise, standard stress electrocardiographic criteria for ischemia (the sole determinant of objective ischemia assessment in prior cardiovascular disability listings) have been expanded significantly to encompass nonexercise modalities (including nuclear imaging and echocardiography provoked by pharmacologic vasodilator stress) to assess the presence of severe inducible ischemia that, when combined with severe angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class III or IV) would meet a cardiovascular disability listing. Additionally, the criteria by which angiographic CHD meet a listing have been specified, and severe CHD is defined by greater than or equal to 50 percent left main stenosis and/or greater than or equal to 70 percent proximal/mid stenoses in greater than or equal to two native arteries or bypass grafts. These updated criteria now provide a significantly enhanced and evidence-based approach for making disability determinations based on anatomic and functional criteria in patients with severe angina.},

Abnormal heartbeats are reflected in the ECG pattern and such abnormal signals are called as Arrhythmias. Automated classification and identification of the ECG arrhythmia signal that provides faster and more accurate result is increasingly becoming the need of the moment. Various machine learning skills have been applied to advance the accuracy of results and increase the speed and robustness of the models. A lot of focus has been given to the architectures and datasets employed but preprocessing of the data being equally important. In this paper, a preprocessing technique that significantly improves the accuracy of the deep learning models used for ECG classification is proposed with a modified deep learning architecture that adds to the training stability. With this preprocessing technique and deep learning model, the system is able to attain accuracy levels of more than 99\% without overfitting the model.},

Repeating segments of the time series are associated with symbols, thereby reducing the complexity of the series. It facilitates data mining tasks to be performed easily such as indexing, clustering, classification, summarization, and anomaly detection. This study involves symbolization through Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) with Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA). The same ECG series is symbolized first by PLA and then PAA. Coarsing the series by PLA proved to be more problematic than PAA. At coarser scales, details are lost in noise with PLA, whereas local features become clearer with PAA. However during the analyses of ECGs of various subjects, it is understood that PAA fails when the series is not perfectly periodic as in rotating machinery. This fact is contrasted with the synthetic ECG which is manipulated to be perfectly periodic to juxtapose the results of the two trials. It is deduced that PAA delivers better pattern detection when signals are truly periodic.},

  abstract = {The parallel explosions of interest in streaming data, and data mining of time series have had surprisingly little intersection. This is in spite of the fact that time series data are typically streaming data. The main reason for this apparent paradox is the fact that the vast majority of work on streaming data explicitly assumes that the data is discrete, whereas the vast majority of time series data is real valued.Many researchers have also considered transforming real valued time series into symbolic representations, nothing that such representations would potentially allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities, in addition to allowing formerly "batch-only" problems to be tackled by the streaming community. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from three fatal flaws. Firstly, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Secondly, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. Finally, most of these symbolic approaches require one to have access to all the data, before creating the symbolic representation. This last feature explicitly thwarts efforts to use the representations with streaming algorithms.In this work we introduce a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. Finally, our representation allows the real valued data to be converted in a streaming fashion, with only an infinitesimal time and space overhead.We will demonstrate the utility of our representation on the classic data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content and anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {Classification of multivariate time series data, often including both time points and intervals at variable frequencies, is a challenging task. We introduce the KarmaLegoSification (KLS) framework for classification of multivariate time series analysis, which implements three phases: (1) application of a temporal abstraction process that transforms a series of raw time-stamped data points into a series of symbolic time intervals; (2) mining these symbolic time intervals to discover frequent time-interval-related patterns (TIRPs), using Allen's temporal relations; and (3) using the TIRPs as features to induce a classifier. To efficiently detect multiple TIRPs (features) in a single entity to be classified, we introduce a new algorithm, SingleKarmaLego, which can be shown to be superior for that purpose over a Sequential TIRPs Detection algorithm. We evaluated the KLS framework on datasets in the domains of diabetes, intensive care, and infectious hepatitis, assessing the effects of the various settings of the KLS framework. Discretization using Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) led to better performance than using the equal-width discretization (EWD); knowledge-based cut-off definitions when available were superior to both. Using three abstract temporal relations was superior to using the seven core temporal relations. Using an epsilon value larger than zero tended to result in a slightly better accuracy when using the SAX discretization method, but resulted in a reduced accuracy when using EWD, and overall, does not seem beneficial. No feature selection method we tried proved useful. Regarding feature (TIRP) representation, mean duration performed better than horizontal support, which in turn performed better than the default Binary (existence) representation method.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) has been considered the top cause of mortality globally. However, countries differ in their rates and there have been changes over time. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed mortality data submitted to the World Health Organization from 2005 to 2015 by individual countries. We explored patterns in relationships with age, sex, and income and calculated age-standardized mortality rates for each country in addition to crude death rates. In 5 illustrative countries which provided detailed data, we analyzed trends of mortality from IHD and 3 noncommunicable diseases (lung cancer, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory tract diseases) and examined the simultaneous trends in important cardiovascular risk factors. Russia, United States, and Ukraine had the largest absolute numbers of deaths among the countries that provided data. Among 5 illustrative countries (United Kingdom, United States, Brazil, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine), IHD was the top cause of death, but mortality from IHD has progressively decreased from 2005 to 2015. Age-standardized IHD mortality rates per 100\,000 people per year were much higher in Ukraine (324) and Kazakhstan (97) than in United States (60), Brazil (54), and the United Kingdom (46), with much less difference in other causes of death. All 5 countries showed a progressive decline in IHD mortality, with a decline in smoking and hypertension and in all cases a rise in obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: IHD remains the single largest cause of death in countries of all income groups. Rates are different between countries and are falling in most countries, indicating great potential for further gains. On the horizon, future improvements may become curtailed by increasing hypertension in some developing countries and more importantly global growth in obesity.},

Recently, it has been demonstrated [1] that exact optimization algorithms outclass these heuristical approaches by a wide margin with respect to reconstruction error. As opposed to traditional time-domain algorithms, where some heuristic is used to extract representative signal samples from the original signal, the exact optimization algorithm in [1] formulates the sample selection problem as a graph theory problem. Thus well known optimization theory can be applied in order to yield optimal compression. In [1], linear interpolation is applied in reconstruction of the signal. This paper generalizes the optimization algorithm such that reconstruction can be made by second order polynomial interpolation in the extracted signal samples. The polynomials are fitted in a way that guarantees minimal reconstruction error, and the method proves good performance compared to the case where linear interpolation is used in reconstruction of the signal.},

Moreover, a novel partitional clustering algorithm is designed which alleviates computational burden characterizing traditional hierarchical agglomerative approaches. Experimental results show that this approach provides an accurate clustering partition and the devised distance measures achieve good performance rates.

In this paper, we propose a method for discovering the rules to describe deviant event patterns from multivariate time series, called SAX-ARM (association rule mining based on symbolic aggregate approximation). Inverse normal transformation (INT) is first adopted for converting the distribution of time series to the normal distribution. Then, symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) is applied to symbolize time series, and association rule mining (ARM) is used for discovering frequent rules among the symbols of deviant events. The experimental results show the discovery of informative rules among deviant events in a multivariate time series from a die-casting manufacturing process that has ten variables with 1,437 lengths. We also present the results of sensitivity analysis, which demonstrates that significant rules can be discovered with different settings of the SAX parameters. The results describe the usefulness of the proposed method to identify deviant event among multivariate time series with high complexity.},

In this paper, a fuzzy-based multi-objective algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is proposed. Initially, an effective FFT is used to extract the feature points in ECG signals, such as PQRST wave's amplitude and wave function and then the proposed multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to classify the abnormality of heart patient. Basically, the ECG behaviour depends on various factors such as age, physical condition of patients and the surrounding environment. The efficient detection of abnormalities (e.g. arrhythmia and myocardial abstraction) can be achieved by initializing the above-mentioned factors and maintaining a database containing previously attributed signals, such MIT-BIH arrhythmia. The present study provides efficiency of around 98.7\% in detection of abnormalities in patients.},

Many high level representations of time series have been proposed for data mining. In this work, we introduce a new technique based on a bit level approximation of the data. The representation has several important advantages over existing techniques. One unique advantage is that it allows raw data to be directly compared to the reduced representation, while still guaranteeing lower bounds to Euclidean distance. This fact can be exploited to produce faster exact algorithms for similarly search. In addition, we demonstrate that our new representation allows time series clustering to scale to much larger datasets.},

Currently available ECG anomaly detection methods, ranging from academic research to commercial ECG machines, still suffer from a high false alarm rate because these methods are not able to differentiate ECG artifacts from real ECG signal, especially, in ECG artifacts that are similar to ECG signals in terms of shape and/or frequency. The problem leads to high vigilance for physicians and misinterpretation risk for nonspecialists. Therefore, this work proposes a novel anomaly detection technique that is highly robust and accurate in the presence of ECG artifacts which can effectively reduce the false alarm rate. Expert knowledge from cardiologists and motif discovery technique is utilized in our design. In addition, every step of the algorithm conforms to the interpretation of cardiologists. Our method can be utilized to both single-lead ECGs and multilead ECGs. Our experiment results on real ECG datasets are interpreted and evaluated by cardiologists. Our proposed algorithm can mostly achieve 100\% of accuracy on detection (AoD), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value with 0\% false alarm rate. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is highly accurate and robust to artifacts, compared with competitive anomaly detection methods.},

However, because a symbol is mapped from the average value of a segment, the SAX ignores important information in a segment, namely the trend of the value change in the segment. Such a miss may cause a wrong classification in some cases, since the SAX representation cannot distinguish different time series with similar average values but different trends. In this paper, we firstly design a measure to compute the distance of trends using the starting and the ending points of segments. Then we propose a modified distance measure by integrating the SAX distance with a weighted trend distance. We show that our distance measure has a tighter lower bound to the Euclidean distance than that of the original SAX. The experimental results on diverse time series data sets demonstrate that our proposed representation significantly outperforms the original SAX representation and an improved SAX representation for classification.},

It is like data clustering and the task of partitioning time series into several groups based on their similarities, such that time series in a cluster are similar and they are not similar to other clusters. In the last decade, symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX), which is a high-level symbolic representation for time series, has attracted the attention of many data mining researchers. SAX enables time series analysis to be applied to sequence mining techniques. In this study, we propose a new approach for clustering time series that utilizes a moving average convergence divergence (MACD)-histogram-based SAX (MHSAX) and the k-medoids method. MHSAX is a hybrid symbolic aggregate approximation combining the SAX strings of a time series and its MACD histogram. By utilizing MHSAX, we can calculate the more accurate distance between time series compared with other approaches. This improves the affinity with the k-medoids method and improves the accuracy of clustering. We actually implemented the proposed clustering method and conducted experiments using the whole UCR Time Series Archive data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Background: With recent technology, multivariate time series electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has played an important role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, discovering the association of wide range aging disease and chronic habit with ECG analysis still has room to be explored. This paper mainly analyses the possible relationship between common aging diseases or chorionic habits of Medical Record and ECG, such as the diseases of diabetes, obesity and hypertension, or the habit of smoking. Whether there is a relationship between ECG and some common diseases and habits. Method: In the research, we firstly conducted different ECG features, such as those of reduced binary pattern (RBP), waveform, and wavelet, and then performed a k-means clustering analysis on the correlation between ECGs and the aforementioned diseases and habits, from which expected to find a firm association between them and the best characteristic used for future research. Result: In a summary, we discovered a weak and strong evidence between ECG and medical records, for the weak that the smokers might have a unique ECG feature vector enabling clustering them into specific groups, so the ECGs might be used to identify smokers and non-smokers. For a stronger evidence, most of patients with diabetes are always assigned into a specified group no matter of the number of classes in the K-means clustering, which means we can find their association between them. It is also interesting, we found that obesity and hypertension, which are thought to be related to cardiovascular system. However, they are not highly correlated in our clustering analysis, which might indirectly tell us that the impact of obesity and hypertension to our body is various.},

  abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, angina, myocardial infarction, and ischemic heart failure, are the leading cause of death globally. Early detection and treatment of CVDs significantly contribute to the prevention or delay of cardiovascular death. Electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical impulses generated by heart muscles, which reflect regular or irregular beating activity. Computer-aided techniques provide fast and accurate tools to identify CVDs using a patient's ECG signal, which have achieved great success in recent years. Latest computational diagnostic techniques based on ECG signals for estimating CVDs conditions are summarized here. The procedure of ECG signals analysis is discussed in several subsections, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification, and application. In particular, the End-to-End models integrate feature extraction and classification into learning algorithms, which not only greatly simplifies the process of data analysis, but also shows excellent accuracy and robustness. Portable devices enable users to monitor their cardiovascular status at any time, bringing new scenarios as well as challenges to the application of ECG algorithms. Computational diagnostic techniques for ECG signal analysis show great potential for helping health care professionals, and their application in daily life benefits both patients and sub-healthy people.},

First, we utilize Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) approach to reduce dimensionality and discretize the mean value of each segment by SAX. Second, extract trend feature in each segment by using trend distance factor and trend shape factor. Then, design multi-resolution symbolic mapping rules to discretize trend information into symbols. We also propose a modified distance measure by integrating the SAX distance with a weighted trend distance. We show that our distance measure has a tighter lower bound to the Euclidean distance than that of the original SAX. The experimental results on diverse time series data sets demonstrate that our proposed representation significantly outperforms the original SAX representation and an improved SAX representation for classification.},

This paper addresses an improvement on Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), is one of the efficient representations for time series mining. Because SAX represents its symbols by the average (mean) value of a segment with the assumption of Gaussian distribution, it is insufficient to serve the entire deterministic information and causes sometimes incorrect results in time series classification. In this work, SAX representation and distance measure is improved with the addition of another moment of the prior distribution, standard deviation; SAX\_SD is proposed. We provide comprehensive analysis for the proposed SAX\_SD and confirm both the highest classification accuracy and the highest dimensionality reduction ratio on University of California, Riverside (UCR) datasets in comparison to state of the art methods such as SAX, Extended SAX (ESAX) and SAX Trend Distance (SAX\_TD).},

Nowadays, there are many anomaly detection methods for ECG detection including supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For supervised learning, it requires the knowledge of expert and different types of Arrhythmia data for training. However, since the anomalies are less and unknown in many cases which are difficult to distinguish and be labeled, unsupervised methods are more suitable to detect the ECG anomalies. Furthermore, the existing unsupervised learning studies do not take ECG shape into account where different diseases have different shapes. In this paper, a novel simple trend aggregate approximation method is proposed, the relative binary trend representation are used to record the shape feature in original time series and to detect the anomaly heart signals by similarity comparison. We use the ECG dataset in UCR Time Series Classification Archive to obtain ECG time series data and the experiment results are assessed by means of sensitivity, specificity, false alarm rate measures which is robust and promising with high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Feature extraction from vibration signals is considerably significant for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. The Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) technique essentially transforming a real-valued time series into a symbol sequence, has been proven as a potential tool of feature extraction for machinery intelligent diagnosis. However, challenge still exists that the SAX cannot fulfill feature extraction tasks well since it is carried out only on the basis of mean value in time domain. To overcome this limitation, an improved SAX (ISAX) is proposed in this paper. This new method substitutes the feature of mean value in time domain with multiple features extracted from time, frequency and time-frequency domains in order to obtain comprehensive fault information. With the ISAX transformation, a vibration signal can be transformed into various symbol sequences according to the multi-domain features. Next the Shannon entropy technique is conducted on a symbol sequence to capture sequential patterns in local signals and then the Shannon entropy value is used as the eigenvalue of the symbol sequence. Various eigenvalues are obtained to describe a vibration signal from different perspectives, which leads to a better feature extraction. These eigenvalues are then fed into the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to reduce dimensions and extract principal features for classification tasks. Compared with SAX, the most significant advantage of ISAX is extracting comprehensive signal characteristics from multi-domain. Moreover, the ISAX captures fault information better considering the local fault patterns. The effectiveness and superiority of ISAX were validated by experimental studies using the fault signals of rolling bearings and reciprocating compressor valves with remarkably high classification rates.},
