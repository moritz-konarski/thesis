\subsection{Anomaly detection or classification accuracy}

make some graphs and tables that compare SAX and MSAX.

How accurate are they for different parameters?

Is my hypothesis that MSAX, by incorporating more than one variable, more
accurate that SAX, even if SAX is applied to both leads of the time series and
then naively connected?

How can this be proved or rather disproven?
