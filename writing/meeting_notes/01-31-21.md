# _Meeting_ 01-31-2021

## Links

- ECG-lib: <https://github.com/FDA/ecglib>
- list of good OSS: <https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/ecg>
- guide on all software <https://archive.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/wag.pdf>

## Notes

- I can model an ECG wave for my diploma work
    - look into almost-periodic functions
- read all the papers
- experiment with edfbrowser--can it be used to confirm R detection?
- look at edfviewer sources to figure out the R-peak detection algorithm they
use
- look more closely at what can be done for ECG digitalisation
- sum of piece-wise non-linear functions from Ilya, work on different functions
at the same time
    - how to add own annotations to edfbrowser
    - creating functions out of annotations
- ecgviewer for MS Windows
- alternatives for reading the ECG archive that we already have (\*.ecg files)
- see how hrv-analysis works <https://pypi.org/project/hrv-analysis/>
- 15 day maple trial

## Todo

- get a brilliant idea--get some first results and start to prepare a paper
- really put in work and try to make some progress
- also work on my own thesis to make sure I can graduate lol
- look into min-value theorem for FFT to estimate ECG
- create a function to model an ECG, maybe improve the functions people use
- create own function from differential equation that matches the parameters
maybe
