## Electrocardiogram ST-Segment Morphology Delineation Method Using Orthogonal Transformations

- time series of features:
- ischaemia is a bad thing, we need to find it; it can be seen on ECGs
- orthogonal transformation:
    - reduce dimensionality
    - represents uncorrelated set of features
    - based on orthogonal basis functions
- orthogonality:
- Karhunen-Loeve Transform:
    - noise estimation
    - visually identifying acute ischaemic episodes
    - represent ECG morphology
    - heartbeat classification
- delineation method for ST segment morphology; change representation
- orthogonal Legendre polynomials:
- LPT:
- Legendre Polynomials:
- covariance matrix
- orthogonal stuff provides information for the entire ST segments, thus being
more accurate than approaches that only use part of it
- shapes of KLT are similar to main ECG ST segment shapes: horizontal, slope,
scooping
- these don't quite correspond to actual ST shapes, so they made better ones
- they create them for a single ECG lead for LPT
- for KLT they based them on LTST DB leads
- covariance matrix:
- see [7] for KLT based transform for pre-processing
- pattern vectors:
- feature vector time series:
- Aristotle arrhythmia detector
- 6-pole low-pass Butterworth filter cutoff at 55 Hz
- cubic spline approximation and subtraction for basewander removal
