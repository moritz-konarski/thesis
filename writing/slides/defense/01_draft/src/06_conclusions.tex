\section{Conclusion}

% TODO: be more clear what is up
% state what the hypothesis is when saying what was found
\begin{frame}{Discussion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item no statistically significant difference in recall for the methods
        \item[→] hypothesis cannot be supported
        \item MSAX has both the smallest alphabet size and highest dimension
            reduction
        \item[→] this points to MSAX being more efficient in
            achieving the same results 
        \item \textcite{anacleto2020} showed similar performance for ECG
            classification, supports this work's conclusion
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% TODO: mention they did MSAX, and phrase their conclusions as supporting
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item could not demonstrate superiority of HOT MSAX for best parameters
        \item contributed the HOT MSAX method to literature % FIXME
        \item showed viability of a discord classifier for ECG analysis
            % relativise this
        \item in future research: different ECG data, different detection
            criteria
            % make sure to put who would do it; rewrite
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Preliminary Results}

\begin{frame}{Preliminary Results}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item compared SAX and MSAX using the top $k=80$ discords (816 sets of
            discords total)
        \item analyzed the relevance of results with recall (sensitivity)
            \mynote{how many relevant items are selected}
            \mynote{recall = true positive / (true positive + false negative)}
            \mynote{this is done because for medical things it is more useful
            to look at a couple too many segments than not enough}
        \item recall for MSAX is higher compared to SAX
        \item if SAX is applied to two leads and the results combined, it
            slightly outperforms MSAX
    \end{itemize}

    \mynote{sax: average = 6.4\%}

    \mynote{sax: average = 18.5\%}
\end{frame}

\subsection*{Remaining Tasks}

\begin{frame}{Remaining Tasks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item perform tests for statistical significance of the result
            \mynote{for example t-test, biserieal correlation}
        \item analyze the outliers visible in the boxplots
        \item compute more sets of discords with different parameters
        \item explore the influence of the parameters on the result
    \end{itemize}
