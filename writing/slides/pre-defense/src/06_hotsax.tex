\begin{frame}{HOTSAX}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item time series discords are sections of a time series that are most
            different from all other segments of the time series (e.g. diseases 
            in an ECG)
        \item can be found by comparing all segments to all other
            segments\mycite{keogh2005}
        \item Heuristically Ordered Time series using Symbolic Aggregate 
            Approximation is better
            \begin{itemize}
                \item discords are generally rare, start with the rarest segment
                \item similar segments are likely to have similar distances, 
                    consider them together
            \end{itemize}

        \item[$\rightarrow$] applying HOTSAX with MSAX to ECGs should discover 
            more discords than HOTSAX with SAX
    \end{itemize}
