\subsection*{Problem}

\begin{frame}{Time Series Discords}
    \begin{definition}
        A time series discord is the subsequence of a time series that is most
        different from all other segments.\\
        $k$ time series discords are the $k$ most different subsequences.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item discords represent anomalies in an ECG
            \mynote{these can be diseases, noise, etc}
            \mynote{the discord does not discern}
        \item can be found by comparing all subsequences to all other subsequences
            \mycite{keogh2005}
            \mynote{this is not feasible because of complexity}
        \item for long time series this is not feasible
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{frame}{HOTSAX}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Heuristically Ordered Time series using Symbolic Aggregate 
            Approximation (HOTSAX) is better:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item discords are rare, start with rarest segment
                \item similar segments have similar distances, consider together
            \end{itemize}
            \mynote{this is the basic idea that can speak up the process}
            \mynote{it is not guaranteed to do so, but it does not decrease
            efficiency}
        \item[$\rightarrow$] \emph{Hypothesis}: apply HOTSAX and MSAX to ECGs to 
            discover more discords than with HOTSAX and SAX
            \mynote{THIS METHOD WILL NOT BE SUPER ACCURATE; MANY ECG changes
            are relatively small and would get lost in the SAX process}
            \mynote{THE METHOD HAS NO AWARENESS OF MEDICAL RELEVANCE OR ANY OF
            THAT}
            \mynote{NOVEL: MSAX IS SUPER NEW; HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED TO ECGs IN
            THIS WAY; ALSO NOT USED WITH HOTSAX}
    \end{itemize}
