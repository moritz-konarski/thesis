    \begin{itemize}
        \item thus far tested: different alphabet sizes, PAA segment counts,
            subsequence lengths
        \item focus mostly on MSAX vs SAX: using MSAX increases the recall
            rate; while using both SAX curves trumps MSAX
        \item explain how exactly the checking and stuff works
        \item used the MIT-BIH ECG database
        \item database has 48 recordings, every heart beat has been annotated
            by experts
        \item use HOTSAX with SAX, MSAX to find discords
        \item use the annotations to check if the discovered discord is
            a normal heart beat or not
        \item in ECG 108, HOTSAX with SAX found 16 discords, HOTSAX with MSAX 
            found 21
        \item statistically significant improvement
    \end{itemize}
