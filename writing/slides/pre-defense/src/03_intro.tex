\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{ECG Basics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item recorded electrical impulses of the heart
        \item leads, voltages, what datasets have what leads
            \note<1>{the leads are I, II, II, V1-V6, aVf,...\\}
        \item time series
            \begin{equation}\nonumber
                \mathbf{T} = \{ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}
            \end{equation}
            \note<1>{don't forget to mention that ECGs are time series}
        \item widely available, used as tool to diagnose heart diseases
        \item heart diseases are very deadly, so evaluating an ECG correctly
            matters
        \item concept of a discord in time series
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Automated ECG Analysis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item automated ECG analysis has become very important recently
        \item methods are FFT, DFT, DWT, ANN, CNN, kNN, filters, other methods
        \item general advantages and disadvantages
        \item general challenges and process
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{SAX and MSAX}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (who when)
        \item time series analysis, symbolic representation, mindist
        \item why is symbolic representation useful?
        \item Multivariate Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (who when)
        \item differences and advantages to SAX
        \item THESIS: using MSAX vs SAX on ECGs should increase the accuracy of
            discord detection
        \item which datasets will be used?
    \end{itemize}
