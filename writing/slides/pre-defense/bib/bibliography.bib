  abstract = {Time Series (TS) analysis is a central research topic in areas such as finance, bioinformatics, and weather forecasting, where the goal is to extract knowledge through data mining techniques. Symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) is a state-of-the-art method that performs discretization and dimensionality reduction for univariate TS, which are key steps for TS representation and analysis. In this work, we propose MSAX, an extension of this algorithm to multivariate TS that takes into account the covariance structure of the data. The method is tested in several datasets, including the Pen Digits, Character Trajectories, and twelve benchmark files. Depending on the experiment, MSAX exhibits comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. Although not superior to 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) and dynamic time warping (DTW), it has interesting characteristics for some classes, and thus enriches the set of methods to analyze multivariate TS.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the diagnosis and management of cardiac arrhythmias in a two-part presentation. DATA SOURCES: Articles and published peer-review abstracts on tachycardias and bradycardias. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Normal cardiac rhythm originates from impulses generated within the sinus node. These impulses are conducted to the atrioventricular node where they are delayed before they are distributed to the ventricular myocardium via the His-Purkinje system. Abnormalities in cardiac rhythm are caused by disorders of impulse generation, conduction or a combination of the two and may be life threatening due to a reduction in cardiac output or myocardial oxygenation. Cardiac arrhythmias are commonly classified as tachycardias (supraventricular or ventricular) or bradycardias. The differentiation between supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias usually requires an assessment of atrial and ventricular rhythms and their relationship to each other. In the critically ill patient the commonest tachycardia is sinus tachycardia and treatment generally consist of management of the underlying disorder. Other supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) include, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) all of which may require cardioversion, although to maintain sinus rhythm, antiarrhythmic therapy is often needed. Adenosine is useful in management and treatment many SVTs although its use in PSVT with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is hazardous. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a characteristic supraventricular tachycardia found in the critical ill patient. While it usually responds to intravenous magnesium sulphate, its management also requires removal of various precipitating factors. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) require urgent cardioversion and defibrillation respectively. Torsade de pointes should be differentiated from these ventricular arrhythmias as antiarrhythmic therapy may be contraindicated. CONCLUSIONS: Supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias in the critically ill patient often have underlying disorders that precipitate their development (e.g. hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, anti-arrhythmic proarrhythmia, myocardial ischaemia, etc). While antiarrhythmic therapy and cardioversion or defibrillation may be required to achieve sinus rhythm, correction of the associated abnormalities is also required.},

Furthermore contamination of an important artifact (baseline wander) is simulated for normal ECG lead II, and then identified using LMS algorithm and its preconditioned versions: NLMS and TDLMS algorithms, to get denoised ECG signals.

Baseline wander is a typical artifact that corrupts the recorded ECG and can hinder the correct diagnosis of such diseases. For the purpose of finding the best suited filter for the removal of baseline wander, the ground truth about the ST change prior to the corrupting artifact and the subsequent filtering process is needed. In order to create the desired reference, we used a large simulation study that allowed us to represent the ischemic heart at a multiscale level from the cardiac myocyte to the surface ECG. We also created a realistic model of baseline wander to evaluate five filtering techniques commonly used in literature. In the simulation study, we included a total of 5.5 million signals coming from 765 electrophysiological setups. We found that the best performing method was the wavelet-based baseline cancellation. However, for medical applications, the Butterworth high-pass filter is the better choice because it is computationally cheap and almost as accurate. Even though all methods modify the ST segment up to some extent, they were all proved to be better than leaving baseline wander unfiltered.},

  abstract = {The parallel explosions of interest in streaming data, and data mining of time series have had surprisingly little intersection. This is in spite of the fact that time series data are typically streaming data. The main reason for this apparent paradox is the fact that the vast majority of work on streaming data explicitly assumes that the data is discrete, whereas the vast majority of time series data is real valued.Many researchers have also considered transforming real valued time series into symbolic representations, nothing that such representations would potentially allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities, in addition to allowing formerly "batch-only" problems to be tackled by the streaming community. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from three fatal flaws. Firstly, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Secondly, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. Finally, most of these symbolic approaches require one to have access to all the data, before creating the symbolic representation. This last feature explicitly thwarts efforts to use the representations with streaming algorithms.In this work we introduce a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. Finally, our representation allows the real valued data to be converted in a streaming fashion, with only an infinitesimal time and space overhead.We will demonstrate the utility of our representation on the classic data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content and anomaly detection.},

We require the level of resolution as parameter, but it can be automatically computed if we consider the maximum resolution of the time series. In order to provide a useful representation for discord discovery, we propose dissimilarity measures for achieving high effective results, and a symbolic representation based on SAX technique for efficient searches using a multi-resolution indexing scheme.

  abstract = {Clustering of time series is one of the best-known grand challenges in time series analysis because of its application potentialities and difficulty. It is like data clustering and the task of partitioning time series into several groups based on their similarities, such that time series in a cluster are similar and they are not similar to other clusters. In the last decade, symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX), which is a high-level symbolic representation for time series, has attracted the attention of many data mining researchers. SAX enables time series analysis to be applied to sequence mining techniques. In this study, we propose a new approach for clustering time series that utilizes a moving average convergence divergence (MACD)-histogram-based SAX (MHSAX) and the k-medoids method. MHSAX is a hybrid symbolic aggregate approximation combining the SAX strings of a time series and its MACD histogram. By utilizing MHSAX, we can calculate the more accurate distance between time series compared with other approaches. This improves the affinity with the k-medoids method and improves the accuracy of clustering. We actually implemented the proposed clustering method and conducted experiments using the whole UCR Time Series Archive data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods.},

The changes in electrical potential difference (voltage) during depolarization and repolarisation of the myocardial fibers are recorded by electrodes positioned on the surface of the chest and on the limb (limb leads). The sources of the electrical potentials are contractile cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). The ECG waveform is either printed onto graph paper that runs at a constant speed or shown on a computer screen. The advantages of electrocardiography come with its low cost, immediate availability and easy implementation. The procedure itself is also non-invasive.},

  abstract = {Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) is a classical symbolic approach in many time series data mining applications. However, SAX only reflects the segment mean value feature and misses important information in a segment, namely the trend of the value change in the segment. Such a miss may cause a wrong classification in some cases, since the SAX representation cannot distinguish different time series with similar average values but different trends. In this paper, we present Trend Feature Symbolic Aggregate approximation (TFSAX) to solve this problem. First, we utilize Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) approach to reduce dimensionality and discretize the mean value of each segment by SAX. Second, extract trend feature in each segment by using trend distance factor and trend shape factor. Then, design multi-resolution symbolic mapping rules to discretize trend information into symbols. We also propose a modified distance measure by integrating the SAX distance with a weighted trend distance. We show that our distance measure has a tighter lower bound to the Euclidean distance than that of the original SAX. The experimental results on diverse time series data sets demonstrate that our proposed representation significantly outperforms the original SAX representation and an improved SAX representation for classification.},

  abstract = {ECG anomaly detection is a necessary approach to detect disease Electrocardiography(ECG) signals before the detail diagnosis process in medical field to gauge the health of the human heart. Nowadays, there are many anomaly detection methods for ECG detection including supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For supervised learning, it requires the knowledge of expert and different types of Arrhythmia data for training. However, since the anomalies are less and unknown in many cases which are difficult to distinguish and be labeled, unsupervised methods are more suitable to detect the ECG anomalies. Furthermore, the existing unsupervised learning studies do not take ECG shape into account where different diseases have different shapes. In this paper, a novel simple trend aggregate approximation method is proposed, the relative binary trend representation are used to record the shape feature in original time series and to detect the anomaly heart signals by similarity comparison. We use the ECG dataset in UCR Time Series Classification Archive to obtain ECG time series data and the experiment results are assessed by means of sensitivity, specificity, false alarm rate measures which is robust and promising with high accuracy.},

In recent years, fast approximate algorithms for discord search have been proposed in order to compensate for the increasing size of the time series. It is more interesting, however, to find quick exact solutions. In this research, we improved HOT SAX by exploiting two main ideas: the warm-up process, and the similarity between sequences close in time. The resulting algorithm, called HOT SAX Time (HST), has been validated with real and synthetic time series, and successfully compared with HOT SAX, RRA, SCAMP, and DADD.
