\section{Idea}

Use the MSAX representation to represent different segments of an ischemia
stress test. Find the MSAX\_MINDIST between the same leads in different stress
test segments. Based on the distance, we could attempt to classify normal and
abnormal changes. Adjustments for the heart rate may need to be made for
accurate results.

\begin{itemize}
    \item use my thesis as one of the main sources
    \item because I showed that it is decently effective, use MSAX
    \item with MSAX, represent different sections of the stress test
    \item find the difference between the baseline recording and the different
    sections of the stress test on a lead-by-lead basis
    \item based on the distance to the baseline, try to determine if
    a condition is present
    \item to not have the naturally higher heart rate mess up the comparison,
    adjustments to normalize the heart rate may need to be performed
    \item an example of such normalization is performed in\\
