# paa_segments

- is_sax ~ recall is significant for only considering individual sax, but not
significant, even negative when considering a combination of both sax
    - tested for different types of paa counts
    - 18 seems to be a good mix of recall and dimensionality reduction
    - for alphabet sizes, we get the same that single sax is worse than msax;
    5 or up seems to give very similar results; for larger alph, the
    combination sax seems to become more accurate, while msax levels out; there
    is not significant correlation though;
