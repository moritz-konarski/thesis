\subsubsection*{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 2D ventricular tissue model
    \item model Hyperkalemia (too much potassium), acidosis (lower
        conductivity)
    \item ischemia might leave traces that can be picked up using an ECG
    \item because ischemia is hard to properly study in the wild, having
        a model is very convenient
    \item they use the Luo--Rudy I cellular formulation for a 2D slice
    \item II. Methods
\end{itemize}
