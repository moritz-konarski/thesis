\textbf{Detection and classification of cardiovascular abnormalities using FFT 
based multi-objective genetic algorithm}, Biotechnology \& Biotechnological

\subsubsection*{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item signal processing and data analysis are widely used methods
    \item detecting cardiovascular abnormalities with an ECG is possible
    \item a fuzzy-based multi-objective algorithm using a fast fourier
        transform is used to extract rough features like PQRST amplitude
    \item then apply an algorithm to classify the abnormality
    \item ECG behavior depends on many different factors
    \item accuracy is achieved by taking into account these factors
    \item maintaining a database of previous results makes prediction better
    \item this provides 98.7\% efficiency in abnormality detection
\end{itemize}
