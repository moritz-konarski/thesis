\subsubsection*{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item arrhythmia detection algorithm for ECGs
    \item uses the morphology of different diseases to make the algorithm
        efficient
    \item ECG -- electric activity of the heart, generally charted on paper
    \item ECG features can be extracted in the time domain or in the frequency
        domain 
    \item morphological information can be time intervals, voltage extremes,
        duration, location
    \item Harr Wavelet Transform for ECG feature extraction
    \item MIT--BIH is used here again; forward--feed neural network
    \item ECG analysis is carried out using a digital audio processing chip
    \item they put a window on the QRS complex to only look at that
    \item PVC can simply be classified by using a threshold
    \item they implement stuff in MATLAB
    \item it works for implementation
\end{itemize}
