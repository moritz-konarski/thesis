\subsubsection*{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ischemic -- lacking sufficient blood flow; generally because coronary
        arteries are obstructed
    \item infarction -- cell death as result of ischemia
    \item heart failure is number 1 cause of death in the western world
    \item majority of that are infarctions
    \item on a cellular level, oxygen is not provided anymore, waste is not
        removed anymore
    \item this fucks with the heart on a cellular level
    \item reduced pH leads to reduced conductivity of the tissue
    \item necrotic tissue is basically non--conductive
    \item use a cell model (Luo--Rudy I) to model ischemia
    \item the voltage potential drops significantly if ischemia is present
    \item the upstroke is delayed and amplitude reduces
    \item the article uses a monodomain model of cardiac tissue (slide 15)
    \item model propagation on an 200x200 layer
    \item when ischemia is present, the wave is stunted and fucked up, parts of
        it might get stuck -- leads to arrhytmia for example
    \item they may use their model to reconstruct ECGs based on the level of
        ischemia that they want
    \item they were able to reproduce qualitative characteristics using their
        model
\end{itemize}
