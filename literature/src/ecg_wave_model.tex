\subsubsection*{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item propose a mathematical model of the ECG wave
    \item human body == cylindrical composite dielectric and conducting medium
    \item heart == harmonic bio--signal generator
    \item can use this model to predict experimental data
    \item ECG signal is due to heart beat and that is due to the signal of the
        S.A. node
    \item the electric field generated by this is then propagated to the
        surface through the dielectric medium that is the human body
    \item many different approaches to ECGs mentioned here, list here
    \item compression techniques to help with large amounts of data
    \item QRS complex evaluation in one paper
    \item the signal measured by an ECG electrode can be represented by Fourier
        harmonic components
    \item super dense maths
\end{itemize}
