  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a technique for automatic detection of ST segment deviations that can be used in the diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) using ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Preprocessing is carried out prior to the extraction of the ST segment which involves noise and artifact filtering using a digital bandpass filter, baseline removal and application of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based technique for detection and delineation of the QRS complex in ECG. Lead-dependent Karhunen–Loe`ve transform (KLT) bases are used for dimensionality reduction of the ST segment data. ST deviation episodes are detected by a classifier ensemble comprising backpropagation neural networks. Results obtained through the use of our proposed method (sensitivity/positive predictive value = 90.75\%/89.2\%) compare well with those given in the existing research. Hence, the proposed method exhibits the potential to be adopted in the design of a practical ischemia detection system.},

Microvolt TWA has been associated with cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death in several clinical studies involving {$>$}14,000 subjects with reduced as well as preserved left ventricular function. Although TWA appears to be a useful marker of susceptibility for lethal ventricular arrhythmias and cardiovascular death, so far there is no sufficient evidence from randomised clinical trials to support its use in guiding therapy. However, several ongoing trials are expected to provide more information about the clinical use of TWA testing.},

Like all other organs, it is susceptible to diseases and age. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. It is measured by the variation in the beatto-beat interval. Its variation may contain indicators of current disease, or warnings about impending cardiac diseases. The indicators may be present at all times or may occur at random-during certain intervals of the day. It is strenuous and time consuming to study and pinpoint abnormalities in voluminous data collected over several hours. Computer based analytical tools for in-depth study of data over daylong intervals can be very useful in diagnostics. In this paper we have discussed the various applications of HRV and different linear, frequency domain, wavelet domain, nonlinear techniques used for the analysis of the HRV.},

Its solution must be determined by some regularization technique in which a parameter controls the amount of regularization of the solution. Therefore the choice of this smoothing parameter is important for achieving the best accuracy attainable given the discrete approximation errors and the noise level on the data. A regularized inverse procedure is applied to data from an in vitro experiment, and a new criterion for the choice of a quasi-optima1 value of the smoothing parameter is described. The performance of this criterion is investigated, and a detailed analysis of the accuracy of the results is carried out.

Earlier investigation of ECG like waveform generation is based on two identical Van-der Pol (VdP) family of oscillators which are coupled by time delays and gains. In this paper, we suitably modify the three state equations corresponding to the nonlinear cross-product of states, time delay coupling of the two oscillators and low-pass filtering, using the concept of fractional derivatives. Our results show that a wide variety of ECG like waveforms can be simulated from the proposed generalized models, characterizing heart conditions under different physiological conditions. Such generalization of the modelling of ECG waveforms may be useful to understand the physiological process behind ECG signal generation in normal and abnormal heart conditions. Along with the proposed FO models, an optimization based approach is also presented to estimate the VdP oscillator parameters for representing a realistic ECG like signal.},

Often these recordings are affected by physiological and instrumental noises that affects an accurate diagnosis of the disease. An exact understanding of ECG waveform may help in overcoming such issues. Mathematical modeling is efficiently used to understand the pattern of 12-lead ECG and simulate real time ECG’s waveform. Real ECG can be taken as a superposition of bounded functions and this property is a defining feature of almost periodic functions (APF). The proposed model has utilized this characteristic of ECG signals to generate the real time ECG waveform with negligibly small error.},

ECGlib has a modular design, and is capable of handling files stored in many different formats, e.g. ISHNE, Physionet and FDA HL7. Moreover, ECGlib provides functions to do standard ECG signal processing, such as noise removal, QRS detection, classification, median beat creation and ECG waveform delineation. The performance of the different components of ECGlib has been evaluated using publicly available databases from Physionet (MITBIH and QTDB). The performance of ECGlib processing methodologies is comparable to state-of-the-art methods. We have also developed a MATLAB/Octave interface for ECGlib and are working on an interface for Python, R and Julia. Lastly, ECGlib comes with a set of command line tools that utilize parallel processing to quickly enable researchers to process large databases. We believe frameworks such as the one described can be used to facilitate research of ECG signals and we are working on making the library publicly available under an open source license.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed mortality data submitted to the World Health Organization from 2005 to 2015 by individual countries. We explored patterns in relationships with age, sex, and income and calculated age-standardized mortality rates for each country in addition to crude death rates. In 5 illustrative countries which provided detailed data, we analyzed trends of mortality from IHD and 3 noncommunicable diseases (lung cancer, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory tract diseases) and examined the simultaneous trends in important cardiovascular risk factors. Russia, United States, and Ukraine had the largest absolute numbers of deaths among the countries that provided data. Among 5 illustrative countries (United Kingdom, United States, Brazil, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine), IHD was the top cause of death, but mortality from IHD has progressively decreased from 2005 to 2015. Age-standardized IHD mortality rates per 100\,000 people per year were much higher in Ukraine (324) and Kazakhstan (97) than in United States (60), Brazil (54), and the United Kingdom (46), with much less difference in other causes of death. All 5 countries showed a progressive decline in IHD mortality, with a decline in smoking and hypertension and in all cases a rise in obesity and type II diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: IHD remains the single largest cause of death in countries of all income groups. Rates are different between countries and are falling in most countries, indicating great potential for further gains. On the horizon, future improvements may become curtailed by increasing hypertension in some developing countries and more importantly global growth in obesity.},

In recent years, detection of cardiovascular abnormalities in patients can be achieved by using electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. In this paper, a fuzzy-based multi-objective algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is proposed. Initially, an effective FFT is used to extract the feature points in ECG signals, such as PQRST wave’s amplitude and wave function and then the proposed multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to classify the abnormality of heart patient. Basically, the ECG behaviour depends on various factors such as age, physical condition of patients and the surrounding environment. The efficient detection of abnormalities (e.g. arrhythmia and myocardial abstraction) can be achieved by initializing the above-mentioned factors and maintaining a database containing previously attributed signals, such MIT-BIH arrhythmia. The present study provides efficiency of around 98.7\% in detection of abnormalities in patients.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, angina, myocardial infarction, and ischemic heart failure, are the leading cause of death globally. Early detection and treatment of CVDs significantly contribute to the prevention or delay of cardiovascular death. Electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical impulses generated by heart muscles, which reflect regular or irregular beating activity. Computer-aided techniques provide fast and accurate tools to identify CVDs using a patient’s ECG signal, which have achieved great success in recent years. Latest computational diagnostic techniques based on ECG signals for estimating CVDs conditions are summarized here. The procedure of ECG signals analysis is discussed in several subsections, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, classification, and application. In particular, the End-to-End models integrate feature extraction and classification into learning algorithms, which not only greatly simplifies the process of data analysis, but also shows excellent accuracy and robustness. Portable devices enable users to monitor their cardiovascular status at any time, bringing new scenarios as well as challenges to the application of ECG algorithms. Computational diagnostic techniques for ECG signal analysis show great potential for helping health care professionals, and their application in daily life benefits both patients and sub-healthy people.},

  abstract = {ECG anomaly detection is a necessary approach to detect disease Electrocardiography(ECG) signals before the detail diagnosis process in medical field to gauge the health of the human heart. Nowadays, there are many anomaly detection methods for ECG detection including supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For supervised learning, it requires the knowledge of expert and different types of Arrhythmia data for training. However, since the anomalies are less and unknown in many cases which are difficult to distinguish and be labeled, unsupervised methods are more suitable to detect the ECG anomalies. Furthermore, the existing unsupervised learning studies do not take ECG shape into account where different diseases have different shapes. In this paper, a novel simple trend aggregate approximation method is proposed, the relative binary trend representation are used to record the shape feature in original time series and to detect the anomaly heart signals by similarity comparison. We use the ECG dataset in UCR Time Series Classification Archive to obtain ECG time series data and the experiment results are assessed by means of sensitivity, specificity, false alarm rate measures which is robust and promising with high accuracy.},
