\subsubsection*{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item using FFT to find abnormalities in ECGs
    \item ischemia or infarct can be seen in the ST--segment of the ECG
    \item ischemia can also cause low--amplitude notches and slurs in the ECG
    \item Holter monitors are ECGs over > 24h, you need programs to analyze
        that much data
    \item major problem is the feature extraction 
    \item mentions a bunch of other peoples attempts at feature extraction
    \item FFT breaks down a signal into its sinusoidal components
    \item nothing that interesting
\end{itemize}
