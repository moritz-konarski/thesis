\subsubsection*{Summary}

Really well done and researched paper

\begin{itemize}
    \item early revascularization (stenting basically) is essential for survival
    \item ECGs are widely used, but not all information contained in them can
        be extracted, even by well--trained physicians
    \item make a prediction model for urgent revascularization based on
        12--lead ECG
    \item they collected 6 years of data for their study
    \item about 1\% to 6\% of patients with ACS have "normal ECG"
    \item random splitting of the dataset
    \item an AI model that can learn time--dependent data in the right order
    \item 12--lead ECG data for 10 seconds at rest
    \item pretty efficient model for prediction
    \item IFR: validate the model using other datasets; no heed given to other
        biomarkers, drugs, age, sex, fitness; they suspect that the ECG
        contains important data, but they do not know where the data comes from
\end{itemize}
