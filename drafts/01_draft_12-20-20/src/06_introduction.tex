\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Important Points}

\subsubsection{background and purpose}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ischemia and similar diseases are some of the most deadly and common
        diseases
    \item when it comes to ischemic heart disease (IHD), rapid decision making
        is important
    \item ECG is one of the most widely used diagnostic tools
    \item reading an ECG is very difficult, which leads to different results
        among different physicians
    \item to develop software that analyzes 12--lead ECG to detect IHD
    \item this could reduce the time it takes to diagnose IHD, which is crucial
    \item detect changes during myocardial ischemia, some of those remain
        invisible to physicians
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item create a 12--lead ECG analysis tool to diagnose IHD
    \item we will mathematically model the changes of the ECG compared to
        at--rest, nominal ECGs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{questions, problematic, rationale}

\begin{itemize}
    \item the ECG is the most widely used method to assess heart
        conditions
    \item the QRST--wave complex changes when ischemia is present, enabling its
        detection
    \item a mathematical model could make the analysis of ECGs easier for
        doctors and speed up their diagnosis
    \item the model needs to work well for this to be possible
    \item such a tool would remove some of the problems that normally exist
        (mentioned above)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{background, literature review}

\begin{itemize}
    \item heart disease is a significant medical issue
    \item one of the most deadly ones
    \item middle income countries like KG are hit harder
    \item health expenditure in KG is also one of the lowest
    \item IHD is the main killing disease
    \item for most treatment methods, the longer the treatment is delayed, the
        lower the chances of survival become
    \item if the necessary infrastructure is nonexistent, treatment times
        cannot be reduced to acceptable levels
    \item basically, in Kyrgyzstan most modern and good methods do not work
        because of the missing infrastructure and economic limits
    \item computers can help to analyze an ECG, which makes diagnosis easier
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{methods}

\begin{itemize}
    \item get 100 digitized ECGs from healthy volunteers
    \item from this a good model of healthy and stressed ECGs should be created
    \item maybe use FFT for the analysis
    \item use a Maplesoft Signal Processing Tool for wave analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advice from Imanaliev}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Search for the recent advancements in published papers
    \item Search for the advancements in software of the related problems
    \item Study the Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transforms, and their 
        representation on chosen software
    \item Comparison of the different transforms for the related problem
    \item Scan of the paper based verified cardiograms and digitalising
    \item Comparison of the scanned graphs with the verified graphs
    \item Adjustment of the software parameters
    \item Error estimate
    \item Analysis of the results with doctors
    \item Real time method probation
    \item Adjustment of the parameters
    \item Thesis preparation and submission
    \item Scientific Paper preparation and submission
    \item Distribution of the results in media and analysis of references
    \item Adjustment of the parameters
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Content requirements}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item short, verbal problem statement
    \item rational relevance of the selected topic
    \item formulates goals and objectives of the project
    \item refer to some information
    \item maybe a brief description of the main results
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Literature Review}

\begin{itemize}
    \item overview of the current state of the problem
    \item based on analysis of literary sources
    \item don't summarize sources, just give the important information they
        contain
    \item don't just call it "Literature Review", call it something like 
        "Mathematical models and methods of magnetotelluric monitoring"
\end{itemize}
